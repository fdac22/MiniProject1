hello youtube so you've been wondering

what an f2p account looks like after one

year of playing against impact right so

i've been playing since day zero of

gangshin impact i've technically played

since closed beta test two and three but

the progress didn't actually convert

over to the official launch but here i

am on my main account that is free to

play since the beginning of gentian

impact i've been on this account for

344 days now as the time of me recording

this and i'm going to go over

every uh every amount of materials and

stuff that i've gained all the resources

and stuff like that and just to let you

guys know as an fyi i am over live

streaming on twitch i've also not only

have i played on gunshot or played for

against impact for 344 days but i have

also documented

and streamed every single part of my f2p

journey over at my twitch account

twitch.tv enviousity hop by the twitch

channel i'm literally live every single

day i haven't taken a single day off in

the 344 days so with that being said be

sure to give the video a like thumbs up

if you guys do enjoy the video find it

informative helpful anything just want

to help the youtube algorithm a bit and

consider subscribing as well to catch

more uploads like this in the future

let's hop in

okay so starting off here we have our

weapons and we only have one five-star

weapon because we just recently acquired

it via the standard banner i forgot what

it was i probably made a video saying

that i got my very first five star

weapon in the game it was skyward blade

not copium i've really enjoyed it i

loved it i can't really be too picky

about my first five star weapon i think

i got this after like 300 and something

days playing so i think i got it very

recently

okay someone sent me genesis crystals oh

right when i'm recording a video

nice

okay so heart full stop i guess i need

to give a disclosure off the top of my

head i guess i need to give a disclosure

there is a website named codashop and on

this website kodashop.com

you can actually send anyone against

impact genesis crystals with their uid

considering i stream every single day in

my you ideas public information anyone

can send me genesis crystals and that's

what they've done so if if i will let me

go ahead and go to my shop crystal top

up

they send me genesis crystals 60 or 60

uh genesis crystals as you can see it's

only the one dollar one

if i were to ever top up on my own

account i would do a hundred they never

do a hundred because they know if they

send me a hundred dollars worth of

genesis crystals i'm never using them

and it's a waste of money so if i were

to try and top up on my own account

disclaimer i would go 100 they've never

done that they only try and do 60 to

throw in a little meme here and there

and then get a good chuckle out of it

so just keep that in mind

keep that in mind however i do top up on

other people's accounts for giveaway

winners so if you guys frequently uh

come over to the twitch channel and

stuff like that we normally run

giveaways i just got done with a bow

giveaway and we did 11 winners eleven

winners and we topped up at least a

hundred dollars some accounts we had to

top up a little bit more like fifty

dollars extra because we ended up losing

fifty fifty so yes we do run giveaways

over on the twitch channel feel free to

drop a follow and stuff like that as

well if you guys wanna hang out use your

free twitch prime sub all that good

stuff but here we go we have many level

90 weapons like 20 20 i think we have 20

level 90 or 21 level 90 weapons but 20

of them are four star weapons here most

of them are the craftable weapons uh we

just recently acquired dragon's bane so

that was pretty cool and we're just now

leveling up lions roar for the chin that

we recently got we're trying to get

resources for that as well we got some

cool weapons we're still missing the

flute we have no battle pass weapons

obviously because this wouldn't be a

free-to-play account if i bought battle

pass right so no battle pass weapons

unfortunately we have to work with what

we got i never did buy the black cliff

weapons because normally when i do

showcasing in the abyss runs we'd use

uh like the craftable weapons you can

get from blacksmith something that's

more relatable i assume but black cliff

weapons are probably poggers as well

here are all the three star weapons i

have the harbinger of dawn level 90.

and if we scroll down my mystic

enhancement orders we have 4 330. here

are all my artifacts which i will leave

my artifacts at the end of the video i

really don't want to go in depth or

maybe i'll do it in another video so

this video is not too long i'll put this

i'll put all my artifact information

stuff at the end

of uh this video or in a future video

when i do my character builds but here

are all my five star artifacts tldr

they're all copium

they're all copium and they are not that

great most of my resources and my resin

has to go towards something else and i

don't have enough time to actually or

time and resin to focus on artifacts i

have to focus on talentbook materials xp

or mora speaking of xp we have 216 which

is not that much i don't know the map

off the top of my head

but i'm pretty sure you need like 250 xp

tickets to level up a brand new

character from level one to level 90 or

something like that the purple heroes

wits so this is this is not even enough

to level up a new character and there's

still kokomi coming out there's still

aylor the five star character five star

that we don't have yet or i don't have

um

i recently got a cujo sara and she's at

like level 20 or something and i don't

have enough to level her up so we're

still missing a lot of uh xp tickets but

we do have a lot of other boss materials

five thousand realistically i should i'm

a casual farmer look i am

even though i've played for 344 days i

don't really go around farm extensively

like other people do right like i should

realistically be capped out on some of

these materials for playing for such a

long time but i'm not so most of these

materials i think are quite low you know

do i need 3 000 of them probably not i'm

pretty sure i'm safe and guaranteed for

the rest of the game and i don't have to

worry about it but when you play the

game for 344 days this is kind of what

your account is going to look like in

terms of like all your resources and

stuff as you can tell i'll take cat off

screen for a little bit so you can see

the numbers

on the left side here you have a little

bit of boss materials here with divalent

with the north way too many i normally

don't level my talents up to nine and

ten especially like nine and ten i i

normally stop at eight uh which is why i

have a lot of these boss materials and

the reason being is it's pricey it is so

pricey to level up talents like most of

the time i'll keep my talents at like

six seven or eight you know i've never i

don't have a single character in the

game that's level nine for talents

because of how pricey it is so if you

look at this and you think it's a lot

it's not really a lot it's just that i

never actually used them yet on

characters you know i mean it could be a

lot who knows i gotta do the math and

see if i if i don't need to farm these

anymore we have our boss drops here our

gemstones character essential materials

a few talent books here for

freedom resistance basically we just

stocked stock we stocked up on a lot of

talent books right because there's some

characters that we don't have yet that

might need these

we have elegance

we have 11 crowns like i said i haven't

crowned anyone in the game yet no one

has gone beyond talent level 8 because

it is very pricey very expensive to do i

don't know when i will crown a character

uh if i had to choose anyone i'd

probably crown main character or kazuha

kazuha is my favorite character in the

game main character kind of deserves it

because their main character and all but

that's just my opinion right

so yeah those are all my resources right

there after 344 days we have our food

now which is kind of like a restaurant

we have 189 holy water and you can only

buy one holy water a day

so i started doing this like 189 days

ago i wish i found out about this sooner

you go to springvale talk to the guy um

who's selling it holy water one a day

i still buy it because you know i'm just

addicted to getting it now at this point

and we have all the rest of our food we

normally max out on all the new recipes

and perfect them and all that good stuff

so

a lot to go around there

we have materials now strange tooth you

get this from dragon spine and i stopped

farming it after because you can only

use the dragons the strange tooth for

crafting the dragon spine spear i think

that's it

but i probably should try and find some

other use for it in the future because

well i mean that's just copium thoughts

you know i wouldn't recommend farming

this to be quite honest with you but we

have wood but i do recommend farming are

crystal chunks crystal chunks and

magical crystal chunks every day without

fail i will always make sure i grab the

crystal chunks and the amethyst lumps so

we can actually go to the blacksmith and

craft 30 mystic enhancement orders a day

which is why you saw me with 4 000 after

having like how many five or four star

weapons and stuff leveled up to 90.

definitely recommend doing that we have

our prototypes here

yes after 344 days of playing i still do

not have a bow prototype billet that's

kind of false i think i ended up getting

one recently from an event but the point

of the matter is it shouldn't take me

that long event to actually get a

prototype billet like the weekly bosses

are such a scam for some odd reason i've

been playing this game for 344 days

almost a year and i don't have a

prototype billet yet something needs to

change like mihoyo really needs to fix

the weekly bosses because you get to a

certain point where you're going to have

all these boss materials and you're

going to think to yourself do i really

want to do the weekly boss but then you

think to yourself but i'm free to play

and i need refinements on my weapon

right

mihoyo has to change something this

can't be right the fact that i've played

for 344 days and i can't get a bow

billet to save my life

it can't be right you can tell i haven't

used any refinements right here see no

refinements on the prototype crescent uh

wind blue mode was a free one that came

out with an event

um compound bow and i don't even have

the hama i don't even have the hama umi

bow yet put that into perspective

the new

bow

that came out with an inazuma the

craftable i don't have yet

i don't

that's how down bad i am right now i am

down bad

344 days me hoyo 344 days no bow billet

that's insane that's crazy

and once i get one i have to use it on

the other bow so yeah let's just take

that into perspective

uh here are all the other resources down

here some fishing that they recently

added i haven't really been fishing too

much so we have a couple of fish here we

did get the catch and we need these for

refinements some mushrooms

um mints

bowel chilled meat etc all the other

specialties down here like sakura blooms

dendrobiums and naco beads that we've

been collecting and stocking up on seems

pretty good

seems pretty good

we have the serrated teapot all the

little gadgets that we have so we took

part in both of the events we got the

gold sealy and the purple sealy all the

other wind bloom stuff festivals all the

festivals gadgets we've done we've made

sure i mean we're signing in every

single day right so all the other

sealies and pets we have of course here

are all the quest items which spoiler

alert may reveal some things that you

haven't actually done yet

uh nothing too exciting to look at there

uh we do have this northlander billet

trove that i could open

or a bow billet and i could use it to

craft the new craftable bow but with how

rng these prototype billets are my big

fear is i finally open it right i use it

on the bow billet and then next week i

do all my weekly bosses and i get like

five bow billets

and then i need to get no more claymore

billets and i just need more claymores

then you know so i'm trying to like hold

on to it for when i desperately

desperately desperately want to use it

because i'm not that interested in using

the new craftable bow to be quite honest

with you i have other bows to use but

still they still need to up the change

our birthday cake that we got which

yesterday was my birthday hey convenient

we we got our birthday yesterday so i

very i got my first cake ever that was

cool some lanterns from lantern right

some conde or condensed resin we have

stocked up the extra jokulus and uh

animuculus still collecting the

electrocution eyes here

uh our sigils that we still are hoarding

onto i guess some fragile resin that we

have

um and all that dream solvent and dust

now was there anything for furnishing

not so much so that was all the stuff in

my bag

that we have acquired and accumulated

over 344 days of playing against impact

okay let's transition over to the

archive the character archive in

specific these are all the characters

that we have most of the five stars i

don't have because i've skipped i've

skipped many banners i've skipped john

lee twice we skipped the albedo banner

gone you shall tell we skipped clea

banner twice venti banner twice our

tagly banner twice and the yoyo mia

banner you've only rolled on the right

in shogun kami sato ayake kazuha and

eula so four limited characters is what

we rolled on and we got

i think pretty lucky on a few of them we

have videos posted that you can you can

uh check out

uh and out of 344 days the only four

star we're missing is razer so we have

all the four stars in the game besides

razer and most of the five stars i just

didn't want so i ended up skipping on

those banners let's transition over to

the achievements rather in 344 days

we've accumulated over 451 achievements

we have still yet to complete the hero's

journey which we have to do by doing ley

lines

i i told myself i was going to do one

leyline a day but that doesn't happen so

we're at 509 out of 800 for the last one

there but most of our stuff is 100

completed besides the naya stone harbor

some of the achievement quests that you

need to get in monsta leewa and inazuma

uh rome teapot which will take some time

because of the planting one right now we

have innozuma progress that we can't

complete yet this one that we can

complete but i haven't actually fully

explored at watsatsumi island and then

fishing which apparently you have to

catch two thousand fish so good luck

with that one the 451 achievements and i

think there are 500 achievements total

in the game currently now if we want to

go more in depth on my characters

we have a zero constellations on my bell

we have three on yonfe

one on sucrose zero on saiyu

obviously the main character is there

these

core seven characters we'll get to them

in a second i'll talk about them more in

depth we have uh

zero on eula c1 on kazuwa spoiler alert

you might want to check out my summoning

video for kazuha

uh gene c zero i can c0 diona c1 bennet

all that good stuff ninguang c6

[Music]

so yeah these are all the constellations

that we have right here and the reason

why i don't activate my constellations

for the core 7 is because i like to do

little showcasings on my channel uh

clearing the abyss like the new abyss

rotations and stuff like that seeing how

many stars we can get with just these

core seven because these core seven are

the ones that you can get in the game

and no matter when you start playing the

game two years from now five years from

now 20 30 50. you name it you will

always be able to get these characters

in the game official event is gone some

people don't have official if they

started playing diana event gone some

people don't have diana beto still gone

some people don't have her so i normally

just use these core seven and you'd be

surprised with what we can get done in

the abyss for for spinal abyss yes you

can clear floor 12 chamber three um with

seven characters and i was able to

actually get i think 30 stars 30 stars

in these spiral bits so that's not bad

30 stars out of 36 with just seven

characters and

three of those characters are barbara

lisa and amber so let's take that as you

will

all right and that was basically it uh

for anyone curious we are ar 57 with 123

000 xp moving forward oh wait i also

forgot to show off my primo jumps so

full disclaimer right here i did mention

how many banners i skipped in the game

countless banners and i've only wished

on four limited banners since the game

came out we have 83 000 primo gems but

we should technically be at like 30 000.

i'm not afraid to say this because i've

always been transparent especially with

the twitch chat i mark it down minus

51.5 k so normally i will get content

creator program gems from me hoyo uh

every month or something like that and i

write them down but theoretically we

have not actually dipped into those

primo gems yet we haven't used them so

as long as i don't drop below 51 000

everything else that i required

still obtainable i don't think i will

ever actually dip into those because i

think i'm working on a process of

getting them removed and transferred uh

someplace else so we'll have to wait and

see realistically if you've been playing

since the beginning of the game you

should be well over a hundred thousand

primo gems i think 112 000 primo gems

now if i'm doing the math correctly in

my head from day one you should be at

112 000 primo gems which would put me at

160

3 000 primo gems if i didn't wish at all

including the content creator program so

i should be at 161 000 primo gems or 63.

you should be at like 112 000 primo

jumps if you didn't wish on banners but

i know wishing is pretty hard to do and

you can't

who can resist skipping on zhong li

twice right

yeah man this one i'm guilty i did i did

just to show you guys right here amber

we joined on uh september 27th

so anniversary is coming up

amber during my party september 27th

just for a little bit of proof that we

did play since the beginning of the game

but that was it that was it i'll

probably still i mean i mean i think i'm

getting it shanghai on the third rerun

but we'll see

we'll see that was it that was the

entire account i hope you guys enjoyed

looking at it as i said before i am

streaming every single day live right

now as i'm recording this video with my

beautiful twitch chat

uh over at twitch.tv enviousity no

secrets here nothing to hide full

transparency i'm more than happy to show

off anything and everything on my

account we always document everything

live i never really actually play this

game offline because let's be honest me

playing gunshot impact offline is so

boring i hate it it is straw it is

suffering you know it is actually

suffering but hey maybe with the new

fishing event that came out maybe i'll

just fish offline

you know maybe i'll just fish online but

with that being said hope you guys

enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up if

you did and feel free to subscribe if

you want to catch more uploads as far as

my artifact goes i will upload a future

video going over all my copium artifacts

as well as all my character builds so be

on the lookout for that video if you are

curious about what artifacts i'm rocking

and what i managed to get on my

artifacts over 344 days you'll be

surprised with how great and amazing

these artifacts are you won't believe

what you can obtain in a year okay look

forward to that video

i'll catch you guys next time
