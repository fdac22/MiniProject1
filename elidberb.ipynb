    "# Gathering all the posts from a Subreddit\n",
    "**Description:** `gather_data_from_subreddit` takes two arguments `subreddit` and `category` and returns a Pandas DataFrame with the compilation of posts gathered from multiple requests to the subreddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). I was only able to gather about ~900 posts from the \"new\" category within each subreddit, ~300 posts from the \"hot\" category, and ~20-100 posts from the \"top\" category. This is because Reddit only allows you to get the 1000th post within a subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/d4w65t/why_cant_i_access_any_post_past_the_1000th_post/). I might use a 3rd party service like https://pushshift.io/ to gather more posts; however, I did not think it was necessary for this project. I was able to gather enough data to make some interesting analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work Cited:** https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-the-reddit-api-in-python-5e05ddfd1e5c -- Please note that I used this as a reference to make multiple requests, but changed it to match my needs."
