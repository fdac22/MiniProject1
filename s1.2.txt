hello youtube today we're going to be

showcasing an account that has been on

gentian impact purely free to play for

500 days now so if you guys don't know

this is my account currently as you see

and as if we go over the character

archive and take a look at amber she's

joined us on september 27th 500 days ago

and we are going to showcase everything

that we've acquired all the characters

we've gotten weapons achievements all

that good stuff to let you know if i've

been actually farming every day like i

should be or if i've been slacking so

without further ado let us hop in if you

like the video feel free to subscribe

like all that good stuff join us over on

twitch we are currently live every

single day i have been

live playing games and impact every

single day for 500 which is probably

unhealthy and i should probably take a

day off but uh but yeah so here we go we

have weapons two five-star weapons i

know only two five-star weapons these

came from the standard banner we don't

wish on weapon banner personally we have

a couple bows here that are not used

most of our resources and our amore as

you will see because i don't really have

much has gone into the weapons level 90.

now i know a lot of people can get by

with just level 80. i have a thing where

i like to level them up to 90.

all the four-star weapons along with our

mystic enhancement ores down here we've

been crafting 30 a day via the

blacksmith we have over 7000 which is

pretty good and reasonable for having

like 27 ish 90 weapons that's decent our

artifacts which we'll get into a little

bit after i suppose we got a couple here

i'll show off some good ones 403 heroes

with 1500 of the adventures experience

now this is where most of my resources

also go so since the beginning of the

game i've been farming the weekly bosses

which is not a good idea there's five

weekly bosses currently and i've still

been farming de valen both for the north

as you can see i have 45 51 32 and

that's not really all that necessary

especially with the dream solvent now

you are able to level up all of your

characters to a triple crown if you want

and we don't really need all these boss

drops i am spending a little bit of

resin wasting it i would say we also

have a couple other boss materials here

because i'm trying to get level 90 on

other characters meow

god damn it ina

on to the food items now we have 339

holy water now you can only buy one a

day i've gotten 339 i didn't know about

the holy water back then i have been

buying it every day since i found out

about it i think my goal is to get like

365. it's completely worthless until

sumeru comes out so if you guys do want

to stock up on holy water then i i would

recommend buying this it's in springvale

you buy from a guy some seller i forgot

his name but yeah holy water will have a

purpose soon i'm pretty sure there we go

a bunch of food items we we craft up

literally everything here so we have a

whole restaurant uh this is where the

casual farming starts i don't really

have that much wood i don't really

teapot game so we have like 95 of these

52 of those crystals were maxed out on

surprisingly now bow prototypes the game

has been very fortunate and has blessed

me with a few prototypes that's good

running low on crystal is because we

crafted on the mystic enhancement wars

every day other resources down here i'll

take chat out of the way so you guys can

see 988 a couple of those 1800 3000 a

bunch of stuff from teapot gaming and

stuff we're technically good for all

characters that release pretty much and

now here we go to the gadgets we have

every gadget or we should have every

gadget in the games we have both of

these sealies that came out we have the

quest items not really anything special

precious items we have the dream

solvents 53

53 dream solvents which is also me

trying to explain that we didn't need

all those boss materials our birthday

only one all the wishes here 71 fragile

resin we should be at like 110 or

something we did spend like 40 resin on

domains way back but we've been saving

up for a little bit still have that

billet trove on top of that and that's

it

that's pretty much it for everything in

our a little bag there quick showcase of

the achievements 560. still have yet to

complete the bouncy of the earth

i don't really do ley lines as much i've

been farming a bunch of boss materials

and weapon essential materials as you

guys can see and i'm also missing a

little neat little fact here i haven't

gotten the heart island achievement yet

so when i played the game i

i know no one asked this but when i

played the game

me and my wife uh she didn't start when

i did i've been waiting for her to get

the appropriate level and now with me

hoyo allowing me to decrease my world

level down

and she just got ar 50 i'm actually able

to have her join my world and we can get

that on valentine's day so that's kind

of cool let's move on to the characters

here let's move on to the characters so

so far out of the game we have two

five-star weapons let me see how many

limited we have we just got ganyu and

zhang li with this current update so

these are the two new additions we have

but we have two three four five six

seven

seven am i missing one seven limited

characters did i skip over cause you

have one two three four five i skipped

over kazu ha ha why do i do that i think

it's because he looks very similar to

the traveler right so i'm like okay

that's traveler i i don't know i don't

know eight limited characters and

surprisingly

i don't want to jinx it by saying this

all right someone please knock on wood

we don't have chichi we have jean d luke

mona and kaching

no chichi yet

so we've been dodging which is really

good i'm proud about that and now i'm

also proud about some of the artifacts

we have as well so i haven't really been

able to farm artifacts as much but most

of my boss artifacts are actually really

good so we have this gladiator nostalgia

i've put all the good artifacts i think

like the best ones on my traveler here

because i'm uh i'm i'm a very big

traveler traveler maine we're trying to

go for the triple crown if i can get the

mora situated we have some pretty decent

decent artifacts here this one's not as

good we have a geo damage goblet that's

in gladiator set with 19 crit damage 7.4

pretty decent

my ryden i made a video titled i had or

i showcased the worst ride impossible

with like a 60

90

ratio ryden we're now at 45 162

i've been able to farm artifacts and get

better luck on my ryden as you can see

here we have a better flower we have a

better feather which is nice 10 crit

minimum 10 crit minimum right there

uh still 84 em on the sands working on

that

gladiator

really good right like our glass i feel

like our gladiator artifacts are

probably some of the best ones here you

just got a recent gladiator goblet for

my xiang ling 25 crit damage attack

percent 11 2.7 crit like i think that's

where most of my luck is and it's no

surprise i farm bosses like all day

every day right so we have good wanderer

pieces as well as you can see 26 7.4

uh that's uh i guess that's decent

19.8 crit

i think our amber has most of the other

good wander pieces eight twenty one

we have this is still my best one

believe it or not

pyro's copium brick damage that's copium

as well

barbara you just slap on anything on her

she's okay i think are

no wall has some decent artifacts as

well

the thing is we need to farm artifacts

most of our characters don't really have

the best our ratios are basically the

standard about 51 150 right so we have

48 194 on main character 53 120 8

58 148 my right in now is a 45 162

it was a 49 175

we're averaging around like 50 to 60

percent crit and like

140 to 150 160ish strict damage on most

of our characters they've gotten a lot

better since the last time i've done a

showcasing which is nice last but not

least are the uh the talents of my

characters most of them are eight

currently so we have triple eight on

main character triple eight on xiang

ling

kaya even my barber yes i'm going to be

going for triple nine on her and

possibly crowns noel lisa amber

may uh

zhang li not for the auto attack yet

kazuha most of my characters are eight

so most of my investment goes towards

that so i know a lot of people are going

to be saying that i should be farming

more artifacts but what i do for my

playthrough on gentian impact is i farm

for things that are guaranteed i get the

guaranteed stuff out of the way so

talents i'll be getting out of the way

uh weapon ascension materials i'll be

getting out of the way boss materials to

level them up to 90 is what i'll be

getting out of the way it's very

more taxing i'd say right

uh i'd be surprised actually if your

guys accounts probably look a little bit

better in terms of mine now you might

not have as many resources as i do

because i play this game every day and i

go around and farm but most of the stuff

that i get is worthless do i need 9 000

heavy horns no do i need 5 000 slime

condensates no do i need

the

99999 berries

is that going to give me an advantage in

the game

probably not anyways most of the stuff i

farm is copium it's bad it's garbage

it's not worth it

but i like to hang out with the chat

whenever i'm live

and my mind goes off you guys know it

there's not that much gentian content

going on currently in patch 2.4

especially with the week left for jean

lee banner everyone's waiting for 2.5

while i'm on i don't want to just go

live for 30 minutes and that's it end my

stream right there right i want to just

hang out still so we go around we farm

some useless stuff it's not going to

give you an upper hand or anything at

most you probably only need 30 to 1 hour

in ancient impact but the main reason

why i wanted to show off this account

because

i forgot to show battle pass we don't

have battle pass of course you get a lot

more resources if you guys are

struggling with resources and you are

gonna say you don't have the time to put

in like i do

um battle pass is still a phenomenal

option you get so much more and more and

i'm pretty much down on more i think i'm

at like 1.3 mil and it's mainly because

i keep leveling up weapons and

questionable weapons as well people

won't actually approve that because i've

leveled up like say prototype amber here

for example um the hakushin ring and

stuff like that you know crescent pike i

don't think anyone uses these weapons

anymore but i am very fond of these core

seven characters so i've invested in

them these are my only level 90

characters but even with all that i

still am able to get nine stars on uh

floor 12 chamber three

so as long as i'm able to get 36 stars

nothing else matters i don't need all

the other fancy five star weapons i

don't need all the c6

characters that people have like a c6

it's or a c6 ryden or c6 eula or

anything like that aika ganyu you name

it content with what we have currently

so that was basically everything on the

account i think and just to show you a

little sneak peek on the horiolab

website there it is our account

enviousity day's active 500 characters

36 achievements 560 abyss 123. if you

guys enjoyed please give it a like

thumbs up let me know if your accounts

are a little bit better than mine i'm

pretty sure they are let me know how

long you've been playing against impact

actually if you've made it this far in

the video let me know how long or how

many days you have

um
