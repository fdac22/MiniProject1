hey how's it going everyone today we're

going to be taking a look at my one year

free to play genching account review and

with version 3.0 just around the corner

i think of no better way to go ahead and

send version 2.0 off with a bang and

take a look at my journey throughout it

as a free-to-play player so i hope you

guys find this interesting and see how

my account has turned out over this time

i'm actually pretty proud of it as a

free to play player so let's go ahead

and get into it

so i am a free to play player as i said

the top up was around anniversary time

and that is when i really started

playing the game consistently was

version 2.0 as i said so i've never

spent money on the game as you can see

never bought any of the things as

tempting as some of these are especially

the skins i've never done so so i am a

true free-to-play player and this pretty

much shows that first things first i

feel like most people are interested in

the characters that i've obtained

throughout my time playing genchin and

also the banners that i have summoned on

so let's start with this first and i

also want to point out that all of these

are pretty much rerun characters aside

from some new ones because as a new

player starting in version 2.0 i skipped

the first year of genching so i had to

play catch up which means a lot of these

were banners that i've summoned on which

you guys have seen throughout my youtube

channel is that they have been reruns

because i've tried to catch up the only

characters that i summoned on that were

new at the time was i summoned for ryden

as my first ever summonable banner and i

also summoned for yalon when she first

came out as well now with some of these

characters like amber and kaya you're

going to see that these actually have

different times i did start making my

account for genshin in april 2021 but i

only played until the point of kaya and

even lisa as you can see i didn't get to

september so that's why i technically

consider my account review one year as

of now because i didn't start playing

the game consistently every day for the

most part until

september of 2021 which was the release

time around there where version 2.0 came

out so yeah i definitely don't consider

these two when i really started playing

genching but in that time of the year

i've gained so many characters i have

every single four star and i do even

have a lot of the five stars so with

that said let's talk about the first

banner i ever summoned like i said was

writing shoguns now i didn't actually

get right in on that banner i didn't get

a five star at all in fact because i

didn't have enough at the time and i

didn't realize how important ryden was

so i didn't really grind up much more

for her which i really should have done

at the time

but it honestly worked out later but i

did get kujo sara on that banner and the

reason i'm pointing her out is because

she's the only character on my account

that i have c6 i got a few copies of her

from what i remember on that banner but

i didn't get her c6 until a lot later on

when riding came back around now the

first five star i got you might ask what

was that it was child and he was the

next banner after ryden and i did get

him because at that time i was really

just trying to get my hands on any five

star i could because i really needed the

help honestly but i did win my 50 50 and

he was the first ever five star that i

ever got which is funny enough the first

ever five star i get i win my 50 50.

that's pretty cool so that's how i ended

up getting child now on the next banner

which was who tau i wish i would have

saved a little bit more but i did end up

getting her just not in the way you

would expect i went on to lose my 50 50

and i got my first ever standard banner

unit which was jean i got her from that

banner and not the normal banner funny

enough first same with kaching kaching

is one of two of the units from the

standard banner and i actually got her

from the regular banner which i will

talk about later these characters i

still don't have i don't know how i went

a whole year with playing and haven't

gotten to chichi but somehow that's

happened and i did get another copy for

jean later on on a standard banner she's

the only character i pulled from the

standard banner the other two times i've

gotten five stars on that banner they've

only been weapons which i'll talk about

later but yeah that's pretty much what

happened so i lost the 50 50 with hutau

got jean but because i was still a new

player at the time and i did recognize

how amazing who tao was i grinded up

enough to do a full another rotation to

get to pity and i got the guaranteed

hutao 5 star now that's the only time

this has happened and probably the only

time it will because i don't save that

much anymore for banners i got to be

honest with you and i'm also running out

of resources in the game of course

because i played for so long there's

only new things i can get from like

events and stuff like that i really

don't have like chess and things like

that left over but i was able to grind

up enough to get really two full

rotations of 160 wishes to get putau and

it was definitely worth it moving on

into 2022 i got my very first character

of the year and my favorite character on

my account and justin ginshin in general

gone you now i was so lucky with her and

this is really where my looking engine

turned around 2021 i had some pretty

good luck as you can see i mean i was

able to win the 50 50 and i was able to

get guaranteed hotel but 2022 i got gone

you on the first multi

which was crazy and i wasn't guaranteed

i had a 50 50 chance and i got her and

then after that i went on to summon on

zhang li because i had all the stuff

that i saved up for gone you since i

pulled her on the first multi i was like

well i might as well summon for zhang

lee since i pulled her so early and

that's exactly what happened i made the

video for that as well you can check it

out and i was able to get zhang li i had

to do all the way up until pity of

course and i couldn't believe it like i

knew i was guaranteed to get a 5 star

because i had enough to reach the pity

but i still could have got another

character and somehow i won my 50 50. so

i walked away with ganyu and zhang li

from the same banner times which is just

crazy i got them within a few days of

each other and i i couldn't believe it i

was so lucky after that i waited a

little bit and i didn't summon for about

another month and that's when ryden's

rerun came back i definitely made sure

to save up for her that's for sure and i

had enough to get up until pity and

guarantee myself a five star but it

still could have been something else

funny enough i got ryden on the first

multi and i couldn't believe it i really

couldn't believe it and rather than

summon for coco me i recognize how

important ryden's constellations are so

she's the only one i've really tried to

get constellations for and funny enough

i had enough to get all the way up to

pity like i said and i won my 50 50 back

to back and got a second copy of ryden

shogun i couldn't believe it i really

couldn't have and that's all i did for

the summon video but i still wanted to

summon off screen with whatever i could

scrounge up within that last week before

she disappeared and i got a third five

star the only time i've ever gotten

multiple five stars on a banner and i

got three of them and the third one of

unfortunately was not the c2 ryden that

i would have loved to have because in

the future hopefully i'll be able to get

that but i instead got kaching my second

normal banner unit i pulled her from the

standard banner i did lose my 50 50 but

three times back to back would have been

a little bit much so i wasn't too

disappointed and it could have been

something else i wish it would have been

mona though because right after ryden's

banner was venti so going forward though

i did have a guaranteed five star

similarly to hutau so if i did get a

five star on vinti's banner it was

definitely gonna be him but

unfortunately i didn't have enough to

get pity i was really close but i didn't

end up getting lucky so i had to wait to

the next banner which was kami sato

ayaka i ended up pulling ayaka

guaranteed like i said the only other

character that's happened with was hutal

but who tells experience was a little

bit different because i got two five

stars on that banner whereas ayaka i

only pulled one of her and i had already

had the guaranteed from the other banner

but that's how i got aika she was

guaranteed and i was really happy to get

her but i still wish it would have been

venti just because gone used my mane but

that just means i have to use her for a

melt team instead after that i summoned

for my first ever new banner unit since

ride in shogun in 2.0 and this time i

actually got her jaelon's the only one

i've actually gotten on the banner that

she was released with and i was very

lucky because i pulled her on the second

multi that's right right in shogun i got

on the first one along with ganyu and

then i get yaylon on the second multi

and that's not that's not where it ends

but yaylon has definitely been a big

help on my team ever since and i've i've

loved her so much as a character she's

really cool after that i was messing

around trying to get kooky shinobu and

would you know it on the first multi of

that banner i got aritaki ito yes

somehow i was able to do that so that

was insane he was the last five star i

got so i definitely have pity for

whatever's to come with anniversary but

i did try to summon for kaza and

unfortunately my luck did stop with ido

because i didn't have enough to get pity

and kazaha did not show for me instead i

walked away with two hazel copies but i

can't believe how lucky my five star

look has been throughout version 2.0

it's just been crazy all of version two

it's just been crazy all the way up

leading to this and i'm really happy

with the characters that i've gotten so

let's go ahead and look at the builds of

some of my best characters and some of

my favorite ones as well ganyu by far is

my favorite but i'm gonna save her for

last so let's move on to what i think is

my second best character and that's my

hootau i love hutao a lot her and ganyu

i knew were extremely amazing characters

so i tried to focus on them for sure now

i do have a free to play hootout don't

get me wrong but my self-stats still

aren't that bad 32 000 max hp is a

little short i wish that was like 35 000

bare minimum but it is what it is for

what i have she does have a little low

on attack as well but 260 elemental

mastery is not bad most of that is due

in part to the fact that i have dragons

bane now because i'm afraid to play

player i don't really summon on weapon

banners i have done that once in the

form of yelon which i will get to but i

really don't have any five star weapons

so i'm stuck with dragon's bane which is

really really good and that's why my

subsets are like that so my stats

overall are 62 crit rate 173 crit damage

which is not bad right free to play play

that's not bad considering the fact that

if i get staff of houma that's gonna be

insane it's going to be like almost 70

crit rate and like 220 to 230 crit

damage like that's really good so if i

ever get staff of houma my hotel is

going to get a big boost and i really

think she's the only character on my

account except for maybe elon that

really needs her weapon to be even

better by looking at my artifacts for

her i'm not going to touch too much on

some of these well maybe a little bit

because i am kind of proud of my hotel

now because i don't have staff of houma

i have a kind of balanced flower here

which is not the best as far as crit

rate goes but the reason i say that is

because if i ever get staff of houma i'm

throwing this piece on right here

this piece has 20

hp

and it has 11 crit rate literally if i

had staff of homa i would put this on

and i would have 70 crit rate with an

extra 20 hp that hp deficit that i was

talking about would go away instantly so

i really need staff of homo when it

comes to that this feather is kind of

perfect for her in a way because none of

it's wasted crit damage crit rate could

be a little tiny bit higher but that hp

is really really good

it's really good so an amazing piece for

her and then my best piece i think i

have on my account is the sands that i'm

about to show you

this is my hp stands for by who tow

16 crit rate 12 crit damage and 200 hp

now obviously that hp percent could be

better energy recharge could be

elemental mastery but i i honestly think

this is my best artifact on my account

because that crit ratio is insane when

you think about how much crit rate

that's actually offering me like i don't

have a crit rate circuit on my hotel and

this is why this piece alone is why so i

i love this piece i used to have it on

my gone you before i finally got an

attack percent one but yeah this is like

a perfect piece for my my hotel it sucks

that it's not on set uh but the only

alternative i have is something like

this so yeah definitely an amazing piece

and then i have a pyro damage goblet not

insanely good if i ever get another on

set one because it has to be an onset

one that actually has some decent hp

that's the only reason i use this one is

because of the hp and the little bit of

damage because my alternative is either

no hp really and a tiny bit more crit

damage when i really need hp as it is so

that's why i have this one and then i

use a crit rate circulate with 22 crit

damage a little bit of hp some attack

and elemental mastery so overall not a

bad build it's really not once i get

stalfahoma i really think that's the

only improvement that i need to make

unless i just want to try to get a

better on-set pyro damage one because i

there's no way i'm getting rid of this

piece like this is perfect for hutau the

only other character this would be

better on would be yay lon but she

already has her troubles with artifacts

as well lutel's also only one of three

characters on my account that i actually

have crowned and i have her e ability

crowned which is really good i need to

work on the other ones a little bit more

but that is a crowned hutau right there

the next character i want to talk about

is ryden and she's also not the best if

i have to be honest with you but the

fact that i have her c2

or almost is just it's really good like

she's c1 which is not bad but once i get

that c2 she'll get a big boost and her

subsets are as follows she has 60 crit

rate but only 140 crit damage which is

really bad honestly but i have pretty

bad luck with the crit damage artifacts

on her and the energy recharge is higher

than that when i do put the catch on her

but because i usually use the catch on

jian ling i'm actually not doing that

right now but my writing isn't the worst

thing in the world i just really need to

work on her a little bit more but

obviously it's right in shogun she's

amazing regardless and once i get c2

she'll hit that threshold that i really

want her to yay lawn is one that i'm

really proud of i think she's come a

long way since my resin video if you've

seen it which is my one of my most

popular videos on genshin and her

subsets have gotten better since then

she has 35 000 hp

and she also has 60 crit rate 180 crit

damage which is not bad it's really not

bad at all and that's mostly due in part

to the fact that i finally was able to

get myself hands on an hp sans that's on

set and it's got some pretty decent crit

rate but yeah she's she's got some good

pieces here i mean again if i had that

one from my hutao and i was able to put

that on here that would be amazing but

my elon's not doing that bad she's she's

really not and if i had aqua similarica

similar to staphohoma i think she would

get a big increase but because i don't

have that she's still pretty decent i

have to be honest next up is probably my

favorite four star and that is jesus as

far as how he's built and i do like him

because he's still a new character so

it's kind of refreshing to me but i also

have him built decently well he hasn't

really changed much since my resin video

but i have him at 60 crit rate and 170

damage which is not bad and he's got

quite a bit of attack too he's got like

1 500 but he's not the worst he's really

not most and do part of that is because

i have him with a crit damage weapon but

he has some pretty good room for effort

like to make right here like i i could

switch out the flower for something with

crit rate or even get a better and nemo

damage goblet but honestly it's not bad

like he's he's built pretty well for

what i use him for and i just gotta work

on his team a little bit more but as a

four star he's probably my best one i

would say and last but not least is

definitely my favorite character in the

game and on my account gone you the coco

goat herself and she's definitely

carried me through every content that i

can pretty much do now on ginseng and

it's most do it for the fact that she's

just built really good she really is i

think she's my best built character and

my best character in general she has 54

crit rate which could be a little higher

don't get me wrong but 201 crit damage

which is not bad for a free to play

build and the fact that i mostly grind

wanders troop through the strong box i

don't do the domain it's not bad she has

2

100 attack and she also has 264

elemental mastery which is just amazing

because i use her for a melt comp so i

love my gonyu and she uses the r5

hamayumi which i finally just recently

got because those bow billets i tell you

took a while to get but i finally have

her r5 homie umi which is really close

to an almost bow so if i ever get almost

buffer it would just be because i love

gone you but i really feel like i don't

need it compared to the other five star

weapons i've mentioned as much but man

if i ever get that from the normal

banner my ganyu is gonna be set because

she's just she's great with this weapon

it's really good and just like ryden and

hutau she's three of three characters

that have been crowned and i'm really

happy that i actually did go ahead and

crown her first she was my first ever

character that i crowned even though she

has no constellations she's still really

good and i i love her so much definitely

my best character and my most favorite

one i feel like that's what most people

are interested in are the characters you

have the artifacts things of that nature

but even weapons aren't too shabby on my

characters but i really don't have any

five star weapons these two are the only

ones i have it's a free-to-play player i

don't summon on the weapon banner except

for when yaylon came out because i

really feel like aqua simularqua would

have helped and because i pulled her so

early on into when she was released i

kind of just wanted to do that but i

only have two five star weapons and i

got these both from the normal banner so

i got a kilo favonia that was my first

ever five star on the normal banner

believe it or not and i have that on

bennett and i also have the skyward

spine which i do change out from ryden

whenever i use her with the catch but

that's the only other five star weapon i

have and it's that one not the worst

five stars you could get but i

definitely wish i did have some of the

other ones you know like the miss

splitter even the one for ryden that she

uses or staff of homa aqua simularca

ammo like things like that would be

great but i have some pretty great free

to play options as well i mean i have

hama yumi r5 which is an amazing bow

especially for ghan yu ami noma kaguchi

r5 for aika i have the catch r5 for jean

lean which i know a lot of people don't

like grinding up because fishing can be

annoying but i have that i have the

fading twilight from the event i have

the cinebar spindle for albedo in the

future things like that i have some

pretty good free to play r5 options so

i'm not too disappointed but i do wish i

had some more five stars but as a free

to play player what do you expect when

it comes to artifacts i think that i

have quite a bit of good artifacts but

if i'm being honest this is where my

luck is kind of bad i have really good

luck for some reason with pulling the

five stars but i have extremely

annoying luck when it comes to getting

artifacts that are actually pretty

decent or really good i don't even think

i have a single crit damage piece that

has over 28 crit damage i really don't

like for example here i know i don't

have a hydra one on my yay lawn right

now but 28 crit damage is probably the

highest i've i've gotten something like

that is just kind of where it goes to

but i do have some pretty good pieces

that are balanced at least like this

piece i recently got which i have on my

official right now this piece was almost

perfect and i put it on twitter if you

want to check the link in the

description you'll see that i actually

got almost a perfect piece the only stat

that was wasted is one roll into defense

but 20 crit damage and 10 crit rate

that's not bad that's really not bad i

think this crit rate value was like

three or something as well so that's

that's pretty good that's a good piece

some of the pieces like i showed you

like the ones i have on my hotel this is

an amazing piece and some of them are

just ones that have very great potential

like this one i got the other day which

is an onset noblesse energy recharge

piece which i could use on bennett and

look at these sub stats bit rate crit

damage and a tiny bit of elements of

mastery but this is like a perfect

energy recharge piece for bennett if it

has some attack would be better but man

that that's gonna hopefully be an

amazing onset piece just on set pieces

like that they're just really cool so

things like that i have not the great

luck with on artifacts but honestly as a

free-to-play player that's kind of the

only thing that you're really grinding

for anyway so i'm i'm pretty happy with

some of the sets i've got but they could

be a lot better as well

the only last thing would really be like

achievements i mean for achievements i

have some of these filled up others i

really don't have filled up

but i do take my time with it i mean

i've pretty much grinded the story all

the way up until the archon quests are

done like i finished the story up until

this point i have most of the

reputations level eight for all the yeah

for all of them pretty much monstat

leeway and nina zuma and i just kind of

do them at my own pace but i pretty much

focus on a lot of that stuff in my own

time along with the actual quests

themselves like i said with quests i

mean i've pretty much done the full main

story but i do have some story quests

that i need to do like yay lon for

example i like her so much i really

should sit down and do her quest so

that's something i need to do hangout

events i really haven't done too much

just because i find them a little

tedious but there's a lot of primo gym

rewards in there that i could be getting

as far as spiral of the abyss goes i

have beaten spiral of abyss all the way

through to floor 12 chamber 3 and i have

beaten it with 36 stars before hence the

fact that i actually do have the

achievement for it and it wasn't you

know the hardest thing i do struggle on

some more than others still just because

some of my character teams aren't that

great but for the most part what i run

for my teams are as follows i have this

team which is like my main one with the

kanye jeong lee bennett and jion ling

which are very crucial for helping my

gone you with this team setup i can

pretty much hit 150 000 damage plus with

my ganyu with bennett's ult gianling's

melting and zhang lee's debuffing plush

shield yeah my gun you can hit pretty

hard which is really good another team

which i really use a lot is this one

with my hutao yelan ching cho and jung

lee this is my second spiral of abyss

team that i use when i'm not using gone

you which i use for the other team on

the other half of things and yaylon

ching cho definitely boost up my hotel a

lot and zhang li i kind of interchange

if i'm being honest with you yeah he's a

good shielder since i don't have c1

hotel but most of the time when i'm

doing spiral because i have zhang li

with my gone u team i substitute this

out for like ride in or whatever else if

i had toma built he would actually be

really crucial for this but other than

that this is really the only team that i

use other than my gone you team so

that's gonna wrap it up that's my one

year genchin free to play account review

i hope you guys found it interesting and

i am really proud of it honestly because

i've gotten extremely lucky in some

cases and i've also had fun grinding and

just doing everything i can to make my

account as good as i can and it

definitely has a lot of ways to go

especially with artifacts but with

version 3.0 about to be here i'm hoping

that it's gonna hopefully get a lot

better and be a lot more fun collecting

those units as well but let me know what

your accounts are looking like you know

if some of you guys jumped in before or

after me it's extremely rewarding to

reflect on your account and see how far

you've come and i'm excited to see how

far i can go as well with it but yeah i

hope you all enjoyed this thank you so

much for watching and i will see you all

in the next video
