    "The idea of my project is to compare works from writers who are one century apart. The two works from the same author sets a basis for what kind of vocabulary is used by that author in that century. Then, by comparing the work of two separate authors, we are able to see how vocabulary has changed within the one hundred year span. Perhaps it is rather similar or perhaps it has changed drastically.\n",

    "1. The frequency of a specific word, e.g., \"would\" should follow a binomial distribution (each regular word in a document is a trial and with probability p that word is \"would\". The estimate for p is N(\"would\")/N(regular word)). Do these binomial distributions for your chosen word differ significantly between books of the same author or between authors? \n",
